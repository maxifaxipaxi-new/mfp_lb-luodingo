# Luodingo - Learning App for LB-Phone
THIS APP IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT
Learning with Duolingo is fun, and research shows that it works! Now you can learn in FiveM with Luodingo, not an owl but a frog that is best friended with duo. With quick, bite-sized lessons, youâ€™ll earn points and unlock new levels while gaining real-world communication skills. All possible in FiveM with the custom LB-Phone App: Luodingo!

## Error: Local Files are not working for you?
Then edit ui/index.html:18 -> Change app/index.html to https://maxifaxipaxi-new.github.io/mfp_lb-luodingo/ui/app/index.html and delete the app folder in ui. Thats it and you are now using the hosted version hosted on github. (maybe less resmon, dont tested yet.)
